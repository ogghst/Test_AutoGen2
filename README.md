# Multi-Agent System for Project Documentation

This project is an intelligent multi-agent system that automates the creation and management of software project documentation. The agents collaborate to streamline the documentation process, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.

## System Architecture

The system is built on a multi-agent architecture, where each agent has a specific role in the documentation lifecycle. The main components are:

-   **Knowledge Base**: A JSON-LD file containing methodologies, templates, and best practices.
-   **Multi-Agent System**: A team of specialized agents (Project Manager, Requirements Analyst, etc.) that collaborate to generate and manage documentation.
-   **Document Store**: A file-system-based storage for the generated documents.

The system uses an event-driven architecture, with agents communicating through asynchronous message passing.

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on how to set up, configure, and run the project, please refer to the [**GEMINI.md**](GEMINI.md) file. It provides a comprehensive guide to the project's architecture, development setup, and features.

## Usage

Once the system is up and running, you can interact with the agents through a command-line interface or a web-based chat application.

Here's an example of how to initialize a new project:

```bash
init_project Project: CRM System, Objectives: Customer management, Sales automation, Stakeholders: Sales team, IT team
```

The Project Manager agent will then initialize the project and guide you through the next steps, such as requirements gathering and project planning.

## Contributing

This project is open to contributions. Please read the [**GEMINI.md**](GEMINI.md) file for more information on the development process and coding standards.
